# Can I contribute?
No, this is myself. You can submit issues for requests of things I should do. You are more than welcome to suggest languages and ideas.

# Copying
No license really, I just type things thrown around :P

# Make language bindings!!!
I won't really unless there is a good reason to and if so I'll do it in another repo.
